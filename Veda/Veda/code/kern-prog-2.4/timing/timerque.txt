The scheduler queue

The scheduler queue is unique among the predefined task In Linux 2.4, this queue runs out of a dedicated kernel thread called keventd and is accessed via a function called schedule_task. 


tq_timer

This queue is run by the timer tick. Because the tick (the function do_timer) runs at interrupt time, any task within this queue runs at interrupt time as well. 


tq_immediate

The immediate queue is run as soon as possible, either on return from a system call or when the scheduler is run, whichever comes first.
