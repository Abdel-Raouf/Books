	      our requirements.

Terminals will be connected to the serial port of the system. 
We can 

Connect devices like modems, LCD displays and variety of devices to the

serial port. We can use termios to send data to these devices.
 In most
of the cases we will make use of raw mode to pass the data to these
 
devices without processing (Any how it depends on situation).


Note : To Develop Applications with UI on terminals 
we can make use
of curses (ncurses) library or a high level API like CDK.
