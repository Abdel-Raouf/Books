In a typical Unix environment Users will be using the system from multiple
terminals (ttys) connected through a serial line to the unix server. 

Unix uses termial driver ( tty drivers ) to control (set different 
parameters for data transfer , mode etc. for input and output processing.

Uniform interface ( set of functions and datatypes ) are provided as part
of POSIX which is supported by all unix OS for dealing with these devices.

tty's operate in two modes

1) Raw Mode. (in this mode data is passed to the application as is.).

2) Cooked Mode. ( provides limited line editing capabilities ) , In this mode
   Some of the characters are processed kill ^U , lnext ^V and so on. (we
   can use stty -a for finding current settings ).
