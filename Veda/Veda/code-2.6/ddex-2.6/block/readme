		           2.6 Kernel Block Device Architechture
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Following are Major changes to Block Layer

1. It is no longer necessary to work with a whole set of global arrays within block drivers.These arrays (blk_size, blksize_size, hardsect_size, read_ahead, etc.) have simply vanished.

2. Most of the <linux/blk.h> macros (DEVICE_NAME, DEVICE_NR, CURRENT, INIT_REQUEST, etc.) have been removed; <linux/blk.h> is now empty. Any block driver which used these macros to implement its request loop will have to be rewritten

3. Request queues have, in general, gotten more sophisticated

4. Buffer heads are no longer used in the block layer; they have been replaced with the new "bio" structure

5. Sector numbers can now be 64 bits wide, making it possible to support very large block devices

6. Partition handling has been moved up into the block layer, and drivers no longer need know anything about partitions
