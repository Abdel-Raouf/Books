<h1>Welcome To The Electricity Tracker Application</h1>

This is a minimal WEB4J application. 
It demonstrates the absolute core of WEB4J -- interacting with a relational database using a browser.

<P><em>Electricity Tracker</em> monitors your spending on electricity. It's not a very realistic application.
There are many items left out which should be in a practical application.
However, it will give you a pretty good idea of what development with WEB4J will be like.
It is meant as a guide for those new to WEB4J, and for those having less experience with Java and Servlets.
