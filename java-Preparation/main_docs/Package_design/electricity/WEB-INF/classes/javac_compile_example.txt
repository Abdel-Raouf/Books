This file contains an example of compiling source files for this application, from the 
command line, using javac. It places .class files in the default location, 
in the same directory as the corresponding .java file.

This command MUST be run from the same directory in which this file resides.

Please edit this example to suit your environment. 
If you deploy to Tomcat 6, you will need to compile using JDK 1.5!
Note as well that you need to point to Tomcat's servlet-api.jar.
(Including servlet-api.jar in WEB-INF leads to conflict errors with Tomcat's version of those classes.)
